This package's goal is threefold:

1.  To provide a space where I can store helpful utility functions;
2.  To store data I frequently use;
3.  To have a structured space where I can test out new function ideas.

This package is **not intended for public use**, but feel free to use any of the functions or data stored here if you find them helpful. However, please note that I cannot guarantee data accuracy or the functions' functionality. **Everything here should be considered a work in progress.**

Feel free to reach out to me or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions, improvements, or questions! I'm always happy to learn and improve from others' feedback.
